DevForge - Hybrid Vector + Graph Database for AI Retrieval

This package implements a FastAPI-based backend service that combines:
- FAISS for vector similarity search
- Neo4j for graph-based reasoning
- Hybrid retrieval that merges both approaches

The system supports:
- Node and Edge CRUD operations
- Vector-only search (semantic similarity)
- Graph traversal (multi-hop reasoning)
- Hybrid search (combining vector + graph signals)
